Tools used to manage Autopoweroff
======================================================================

The obvious tools such as Git, Bash, Python, etc... are not listed below; there would be too many.  Instead, only the non too obvious ones are listed here to help out anybody that might be interested how Autopoweroff is being coded.

1. [Glade](https://glade.gnome.org/), a RAD tool to enable quick & easy development of user interfaces for the GTK toolkit and the GNOME desktop environment.
