Hello,
I took the liberty and redesigned your UI for your application,
AutorPowerOff. Please find my mockup suggestion attached.

My suggestion is in line with Gnome's HIG and includes a "top-down" logic
for the user to follow. It all fits on a single window. Here are my changes:

1. Window's content (view) should be more bigger than 520x460, so it would
fit nicely on a 800x600 screen.
2. There are at least between 8 and 12 pixels of space between ANY elements
in the screen (inclduing the window borders, buttons, widgets and text). By
putting this space between elements, the UI doesn't feel crammed.
3. According to the Gnome HIG, rectangle boxes should be avoided where
possible, and bold header text should be used.
4. The Start/End Hour should be a drop-down combo box with all the 24 hours
filled in (includes all entries for every 15 minutes)
5. The "Enable" the daemon should just be a checkbox, not a "enable/disable"
radio.
6. Put all widgets inside a box and give that header the name of the
machine, so the user knows as to which machine he has the power to do stuff.
7. Moved the About tab as a button at the botton.
8. There is no reason for a revert/save button, just an "Apply" button
should do the job nicely. The buttons have the order as defined on the Gnome
HIG.
9. Added a Help button, would be nice to load Gnome's help application with
the help for this application
10. Made the listview smaller, it was way too wide before...

I hope you like it and use it for the next version. Please let me know if
you have any questions.

Rgds,
Eugenia
