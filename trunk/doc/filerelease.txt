Subject:  [ANN] Autopoweroff version 2.1.0 released.

Version 2.1.0 of Autopoweroff has been released.


Autopoweroff is a python script that is started at boot
time, and which function is to shutdown the computer at a
specific time, but only if some conditions are met.

The computer will shutdown if all the above conditions are met:

   1. Any hosts that the computer is dependant on is not
      answering ping anymore.

   2. No keyboard nor mouse activity is detected on the computer.

   3. The user has not disabled Autopoweroff.

One good use of Autopoweroff is for home use, on a
firewall/router server. You can setup Autopoweroff to
shutdown the server every evening at say, 22:00.  However,
your server might serve other computers in your home.
Autopoweroff will shutdown the server after 22:00 only if no
other computer on the network is responding to ping. For
example, if at 22:43 you are still working on your thin
client in the living room, the server in your baseman will
remain up. As soon as you shutdown the workstation, the
server will go down.

A Gnome configuration tool is provided.

Installation and deinstallation is made is easy with an RPM
and a script to uninstall everything.
