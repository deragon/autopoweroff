# Autopoweroff Test version configuration file.

# WARNING:  If you decide to edit this file, edit only the values of the
#           parameters.  If you add comments, they will be lost at the
#           next software upgrade or when the GUI configurator is being
#           used to update the file.  Only values persists.


# StartHour and EndHour parameters (expressed in hours):
#
#   Following is the time range where the computer should not take any action
#   even if all conditions are met.  In this example where StartHour=5 and
#   EndHour=22, the computer will not take action between 05:00 and
#   22:00, local time.

[NO_ACTION_TIME_RANGE]
StartHour=5
EndHour=7


# StartupDelay parameter (expressed in minutes):
#
#   When the computer is booting up, if all the conditions are met and the
#   computer is in the action time range, as soon as Autopoweroff is started,
#   the computer will take action.  Thus, the user will never have the chance
#   to boot into the computer.  This is where the "delay" parameter comes in.
#   If "delay" is set to 15 for example, Autopoweroff will not poweroff the
#   computer even if all the conditions are met, for a period of 15 minutes
#   after the computer has booted.  This allows the user to login and change
#   Autopoweroff's configuration.
#
#
# IdleTime parameter (expressed in minutes):
#
#   Like a screensaver, Autopoweroff detects keyboard and mouse activity, and
#   if there is any activity on the server, it would not be powered off
#   regardless if all the other conditions are met.  If set to 0, user
#   activity on the server will be ignored.

[TIMEOUTS]
StartupDelay=5
IdleTime=15


# Hosts parameter (list of hostnames or IPs, separated by commas):
#
#   Here you list the list of hosts your machine is dependant, i.e. this
#   computer should not take action if any of the hosts declared here is
#   still up (responding to ping).

[DEPENDANTS]
Hosts=server1, server2, server3


# CpuPercentage parameter (integer or 'Disabled'):
#
#   If the CPU usage falls below the provided value (say, '5' for 5%) for a
#   full second, the condition is then considered met.

[RESOURCES]
CpuPercentage=Disabled


#  [ACTION]
#
#  Action
#
#   Action to be taken when all conditions are met.
#
#   Choices are:
#
#     - Shutdown
#     - Sleep     (suspend to ram)
#     - Hibernate (suspend to disk)
#     - Other     (ActionCommand must be supplied)
#
# ActionCommand
#
#   In some cases, users want to specifiy the action command.  It could be a
#   script, a special version of /usr/sbin/shutdown, etc...  Arguments are
#   added after the command.  Example:
#
#   ActionCommand=/usr/sbin/shutdown -r now
#
#   Strictly speaking, the command could be anything, including actions
#   that has nothing to do with powering down a computer.  In that sense,
#   'Autopoweroff' is a misnomer; it should have been called something like
#   'ScheduledAction'.
#
#   Autopoweroff already have standard Linux command hardcoded for shutting
#   down, sleep or hibernate the computer.  Therefore, this command comes
#   commented in the default configuration file.
#
#   Since this option is an advance one, it is not available from the GUI.
[ACTION]
Action=sleep
ActionCommand=None
